# Dotfiles

This repository contains configuration files (dotfiles) for setting up and customizing my personal environment. These files help streamline workflows and ensure consistency across systems.

## Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bottiger/dotfiles.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```
3. Run the setup script (if available) or manually copy the files to your home directory:
    ```bash

    ```

## Implementation

The install script will symlink all existing dotfiles to the source files inside the checked out git repo.
